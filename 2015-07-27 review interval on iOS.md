**Subject:** Please allow setting review interval on iOS

I'm using OmniFocus pro on my iPhone and iPad. It would be very convenient if I could change how often a project is reviewed from my mobile devices, like I can on mac. I would expect to find it in the attached screen, but it's not there.

Hi Chris, thanks for contacting us!

Sorry for the confusion here. I'm happy to report you can change the review interval from iOS â€” via the Review perspective. Press and hold the project name atop the main outline, then tap "Review" to open that project in Review mode. Alternatively, if the project is up for review, switch to the Review mode to find it and any other projects ready for review. From here, tap the text that displays the next review date and review interval to make modifications.

For more information about this, check out the "Updating Project Status with Review" section of the OmniFocus 2 for iOS User Manual: <https://support.omnigroup.com/documentation/en/omnifocus-2-for-ios-user-manual/updating-project-status-with-review>

I hope that helps! If you need any additional assistance, or if you have any other questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch. We really appreciate your support!
