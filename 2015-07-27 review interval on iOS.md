Subject: Please allow setting review interval on iOS

I'm using OmniFocus pro on my iPhone and iPad. It would be very convenient if I could change how often a project is reviewed from my mobile devices, like I can on mac. I would expect to find it in the attached screen, but it's not there. 

attached: a screenshot of the project details screen on iPhone
