**Subject:** Copy as Link doesn't work - OmniOutliner 4.5 (v177.7.2.0.255747) Feedback (pro license XYZ)

In this version of OmniOutliner (OmniOutliner 4.5 (v177.7.2.0.255747)), copying a row as a link doesn’t seem to work.

Action: right-click a row and select “Copy as Link”

Actual result: my clipboard is cleared but there is not a URL on the clipboard

Expected result: a URL like “omnioutliner:///xyz” is copied to the clipboard

Thanks,
Chris Dzombak
