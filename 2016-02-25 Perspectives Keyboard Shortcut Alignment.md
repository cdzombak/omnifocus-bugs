**Subject:** OmniFocus 2.4.2 (v103.12 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feedback

In the Perspectives window’s list of perspectives, the keyboard shortcuts assigned to my custom perspectives are displayed right-aligned, next to the star icon.

But built in perspectives (Inbox, Forecast) show the keyboard shortcut left-aligned. (See screenshot attached, illustrating this.)

This makes quickly visually scanning for assigned shortcuts quite difficult. I think all the shortcuts used to be right-aligned in some previous versions.

Thanks,
Chris Dzombak
