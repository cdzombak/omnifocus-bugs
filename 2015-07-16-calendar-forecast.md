The calendar preview in OF's Forecast view shows events I’ve declined. For example, on my work Google calendar today, there is a meeting I declined, but it is still showing up in OF’s Forecast calendar view.

Hi Chris,

Sorry for the trouble! I'm afraid this is a known bug — the only current workaround is to delete the declined event from the source calendar. I'll add your report to the open bug file, so the rest of the team will know it is affecting you too. Hopefully we'll be able to track this down and get it fixed in an update. Apologies for the inconvenience it causes!

If you have any other questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us!

Sincerely,

Christian Y.
