**Subject:** Touch target size for floating "add action" button on iPhone

See the attached screenshot, in OmniFocus 2.11 Universal [Pro] on iOS.

I have found that when trying to add an action to the inbox, via the “floating add action” button, it is very easy to accidentally complete one of the actions whose checkbox “bubble” is immediately above or below the “add action” button.

Please ask the designers/developers to increase the size of the touch target around this button. This is really important since this button overlaps with other buttons, which have significant impacts when touched accidentally.

Thanks,
Chris Dzombak
