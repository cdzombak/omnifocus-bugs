**Subject:** Allow setting “Complete when completing last action” on iOS

In OmniFocus on OS X, it is possible to set a project to “complete when completing last action”. I use this quite heavily.

When working on my iPad, I miss this: either it’s not possible or it doesn’t show in the expanded project view, where I would expect it to.

This is one of very few features from the desktop version that I’m missing on iOS.

Please add this on iOS.

Thanks,
Chris Dzombak
