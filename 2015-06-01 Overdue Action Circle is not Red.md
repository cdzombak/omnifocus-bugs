I’ve seen this on my iPhone app, running OmniFocus Pro 2.5.3 Universal, several times: an overdue action’s circle is still shown yellow(/orange), not red.

Hi Chris,

Sorry again for the trouble here — thanks for following up with us via email!

Do you use OmniFocus with a Mac or iPad, and if so does this issue occur with these devices too? Also, can you send us a screenshot with the details for one of the actions that is still showing a yellow status circle, when it appears it should be red?

Thanks!
