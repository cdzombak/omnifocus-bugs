**Subject:** Sync error: OmniFocus 2.4.1 (v103.10 Mac App Store â€” Pro Edition)

I had just made some changes in OmniFocus on my iPad and iPhone, then switched back to my computer after a moment and saw that OmniFocus on OS X had opened the attached dialog.

I have simply quit the OmniFocus application on OS X for now.

Please advise how to resolve this with no data loss.

Dialog Text:

> Replace your database and start syncing?
> 
> Your current database will be backed up on your computer, and be replaced by the sync database:
> 
> https://cdzombak@sync.omnigroup.com/cdzombak/
> 
> To use your current database instead, choose Replace Server Database from the File menu.
> 
> (The local database is no longer compatible with the sync database, possibly because the local database history was compacted while syncing was disabled.)
