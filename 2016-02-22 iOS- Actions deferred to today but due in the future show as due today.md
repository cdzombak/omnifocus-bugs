**Subject:** Actions deferred to today but due in the future show as due today

In OmniFocus 2.11 Universal [Pro] for iOS, I have encountered a date display bug in the Forecast view.

I noticed this on many actions deferred to today’s date, but due on a date in the future. The deferred time—like “7:00”—is displayed as expected. But rather than showing “Due [FUTURE DATE]” it shows something like “Due 20:00”, making it look like the action is due today.

Looking at the action’s details, it is clear it’s actually due on a future date.

I’ve attached screenshots which should help clarify this bug.

Thanks,
Chris Dzombak

@OmniFocus @OmniGroup I tried sending this bug report to OF support but it was bounced as spam. Please help? https://t.co/eokBB5jwAh

@cdzombak Sorry about the bounce; has that happened before? We have an open report about the Forecast behavior, as well; adding your info!

@OmniFocus no, that hasn’t happened before. Just to be sure: should I try to re-send, then, or has my report been noted?
