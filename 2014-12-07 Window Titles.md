Currently, when I select/open a Project or Context, the window title never changes from “Projects” or “Contexts”. I see some of the logic here — the title is always the name of the current perspective. But these aren’t focused perspectives so much as they are buckets, and it would be helpful if the window title changed to reflect a project being selected. That would help me with this problem which I run into often: I have two “Projects” windows open and don’t know which to choose.
