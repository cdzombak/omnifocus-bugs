Currently, when I select/open a Project or Context, the window title never changes from “Projects” or “Contexts”. I see some of the logic here — the title is always the name of the current perspective. But these aren’t focused perspectives so much as they are buckets, and it would be helpful if the window title changed to reflect a project being selected. That would help me with this problem which I run into often: I have two “Projects” windows open and don’t know which to choose.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for writing! I've filed a new feature request for this and included your example. We can't work every feature that our users suggest in, but we really appreciate them, and we can promise that each suggestion will be read and considered.

You probably already know this, but I thought I might as well mention that you can right-click on a project selection and choose "focus in new window" from the contextual menu. (Of course that doesn't help with contexts, though.)

If you have any other questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us!

Best regards,

Theo W.
