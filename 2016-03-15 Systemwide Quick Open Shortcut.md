**Subject:** OmniFocus 2.4.2 (v103.12 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feature Request

I would find it useful to be able to assign a system-wide keyboard shortcut to the Quick Open dialog (⌘O within OmniFocus). I’ve written [an AppleScript][1] to do this for now, but OmniFocus supporting it at an application level would be much nicer.

Thanks,
