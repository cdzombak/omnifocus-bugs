**Subject:** OmniFocus 2.4.2 (v103.12 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feature Request

I would find it useful to be able to assign a system-wide keyboard shortcut to the Quick Open dialog (⌘O within OmniFocus). I’ve written [an AppleScript][1] to do this for now, but OmniFocus supporting it at an application level would be much nicer.

Thanks,

Hi Chris,

Nice Applescript! We do have a feature request open on making the shortcut system-wide. I’ll attach your email to that item in our development database so the rest of the team will know this is something you’d like to see us add.

I hope that helps, but if it doesn't, or if you have any other questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. We really appreciate your support!

Sincerely,
