Entering “12/15 8pm” today — December 8, 2014” — in a date field like Defer or Due date results in the date “12/15/08 6pm”. This seems like a date parsing bug, since usually I am able to enter shorthand dates like that.

Hi Chris,

Thank for getting in touch about OmniFocus - I’d be happy to look into this behavior with you! However, entering “12/15 8pm” in a date field in OmniFocus on my Mac behaves as expected. Could you send in a screenshot of your Mac’s Language & Region System Preferences? If a custom region is selected here, it would be helpful if you could send in a screenshot of the “Advanced” settings as well. To take a screenshot on your Mac, hold down the Command and Shift keys and press 4. Your cursor will turn into crosshairs you can use to select whatever portion of your display you’d like to capture in a screenshot. After it has been taken, the screenshot should be automatically saved to your desktop.

Thanks!

Hi Ainsley,

I have nothing custom set in the Language & Region preference. I attached a screenshot of that and an animated GIF showing the problem.
