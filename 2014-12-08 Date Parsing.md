Entering “12/15 8pm” today — December 8, 2014” — in a date field like Defer or Due date results in the date “12/15/08 6pm”. This seems like a date parsing bug, since usually I am able to enter shorthand dates like that.

Hi Chris,

Thank for getting in touch about OmniFocus - I’d be happy to look into this behavior with you! However, entering “12/15 8pm” in a date field in OmniFocus on my Mac behaves as expected. Could you send in a screenshot of your Mac’s Language & Region System Preferences? If a custom region is selected here, it would be helpful if you could send in a screenshot of the “Advanced” settings as well. To take a screenshot on your Mac, hold down the Command and Shift keys and press 4. Your cursor will turn into crosshairs you can use to select whatever portion of your display you’d like to capture in a screenshot. After it has been taken, the screenshot should be automatically saved to your desktop.

Thanks!

Hi Ainsley,

I have nothing custom set in the Language & Region preference. I attached a screenshot of that and an animated GIF showing the problem.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for following up with that info! Could you check to see if quitting and relaunching OmniFocus has any affect on the issue? I’ve set my Mac’s Date & Region Preferences to match yours, and I’m still unable to reproduce the issue on my Mac.

We were also wondering if you used a utility to create the animated gif you sent in illustrating the issue on your Mac - it’s a pretty affective way of communicating app behavior!

Sincerely,

Hi Ainsley,

Quitting and relaunching OmniFocus has no effect on the issue; and rebooting my Mac has no effect on it either.

For that GIF, I captured a movie using QuickTime’s screen recorder (http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201066), then turned it into a GIF with GIF Brewery (http://gifbrewery.com). That’s a fiddly way to do it; a simpler, free choice which you could use is LICEcap: http://www.cockos.com/licecap/.

Thanks,
Chris

A few more notes…

- It turns out this only happens in the Inspector view, not when editing an action in the “central” view. (See attached GIF.)
- Turning off 24-hour time in Language & Region has no effect on this behavior.
- This is also reproducible on my coworker’s Mac.

Chris
