**Subject:** OmniFocus 2.4.1 (v103.10 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feedback

In the attached screenshot, each of the 4 actions is due at the exact same time—in fact, I just set that time by selecting them all and typing “today” in the Inspector’s due date view.

Why do two actions appear in the Outline as due at “17:00” while others appear as due “Today”?

This is in a custom, project-grouped perspective.

I have attached an anonymized copy of my database.

Thanks,
Chris
