Subject: OmniFocus 2.3.1 (v101.5 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feedback

In one of my custom perspectives, today I noticed that some of these overdue tasks (screenshot attached) show “today” while others show “14:00”. *All* of these actions are due at the same time; today at 14:00.

Closing and reopening the window with my custom perspective resolves the issue; after doing so each action shows “14:00” as expected. Closing and reopening the window should not be necessary to get these times to display properly.

Attached please find my Language & Region preferences and an anonymized copy of my database.

Thanks,
Chris
