Subject: OmniFocus 2.3.1 (v101.5 Mac App Store — Pro Edition) Feedback

In one of my custom perspectives, today I noticed that some of these overdue tasks (screenshot attached) show “today” while others show “14:00”. *All* of these actions are due at the same time; today at 14:00.

Closing and reopening the window with my custom perspective resolves the issue; after doing so each action shows “14:00” as expected. Closing and reopening the window should not be necessary to get these times to display properly.

Attached please find my Language & Region preferences and an anonymized copy of my database.

Thanks,
Chris

Hi Chris,

Sorry for the trouble, but thanks for reporting it. This sounds like it might related to an existing bug. Did you leave OmniFocus running thru midnight last night?

# My reply

Yes, I did. I always just leave it open constantly.

Hi Chris,

Thanks for the info. I've filed a new bug, included your notes, and linked it to an existing bug with natural language dates sporadically not updating when the app is left open thru midnight. I can't make any promises, but hopefully we'll be able to track this down and get it fixed in an update. Apologies for the flaw!

If you have any other questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact us!
