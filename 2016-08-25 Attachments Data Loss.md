**Subject:** URGENT: DATA LOSS OmniFocus 2.6.1 (v109.3.6 Mac App Store — Pro Edition)

I’m using the latest version of OmniFocus from the Mac and iOS App Stores and have migrated my database to the new format allowing for e2e encryption.

Starting a few days ago, I noticed my custom perspective icons started going missing (screenshot attached). I re-added a few of them but stopped once I realized what was going on. I checked today and it appears that the majority of my attachments are missing (screenshot attached).

What’s going on? Where are my attachments?

It should go without saying that I need to be able to trust OmniFocus, and an incident like this is — to put it lightly — extremely disconcerting and disappointing.

An update: the Mac App Store isn’t offering me the 2.6.2 update.

I updated to 2.6.2 (v109.3.9) and my attachments are still missing.
